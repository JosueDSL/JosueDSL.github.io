        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p> Iâ€™m Josue, a software developer and educator living in Guadalajara, Mexico.</p>
        <p>I love techology since I was a child, remember pretty well the terminal was one of the very first things I learned when I was 12, till then my whole 
        life has been around computers. Life has taught me through trial and error that things are learned thoroughly, starting from the root.
        I love trees and nature btw :)</p>
        </p>
        <p> That's why I spent 6 months learning Computer Science by taking a course certification from Harvard University, right after I decided to jump in 
          to a higher level and started a Full Stack Engineer professional certification from Codecademy, which I'm currently finishing.
        </p>
        <p> Knoledge is nothing without sharing with others, that's what I think. And for that exact same reason I started to give one-on-one classes teaching
          CS50x in Spanish, which is not available in this language, documented everything, and uploaded it to Youtube.</p>
        <p> Hiking, travel and photography are my main of thousands of hobbies, which you can check on my blog</p>
        <p> I'm currently looking for a job as a software developer, so if you are interested in my profile, please contact me.</p>
