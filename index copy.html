      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
          <p> Iâ€™m Josue, a software developer and educator living in Guadalajara, Mexico.</p>
          <p>I love technology since I was a child, remember pretty well the terminal was one of the very first things I learned when I was 12, till then my whole 
          life has been around computers. Life has taught me through trial and error that things are learned thoroughly, starting from the root.
          I love trees and nature by the way.</p>
          </p>
          <p> That's why I spent 6 months learning Computer Science by taking a <a href="https://certificates.cs50.io/1d549400-858c-44e0-a772-0626e8d27e16.pdf?size=letter">course certification</a> from Harvard University, right after I decided to jump in 
            to a higher level and started a Full Stack Engineer professional certification from Codecademy, which I'm currently finishing.
          </p>
          <p> Knowledge is nothing without sharing with others, that's what I think. And for that exact same reason I started to give one-on-one classes teaching
            CS50x in Spanish, which is not available in this language, documented everything, and uploaded it to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMbdJMoTREYUy26fWNmroSh3tAqGFf9Vx&si=gAjOs_xqABSOZOvC">Youtube</a>.</p>
          <p> Hiking, travel and photography are my main of thousands of hobbies, which you can check on my blog</p>
          <p> I'm currently looking for a job as a software developer, so if you are interested in my profile, please contact me at <a href="mailto:josue@josueds.me">josue@josueds.me</a></p>
